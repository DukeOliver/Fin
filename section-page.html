      <h3>Smell Ya Later!</h3>
      <p>In west Philadelphia born and raised, on the playground was where 
        I spent most of my days. Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool, and 
        all shootin some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys 
        who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood. I 
        got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said 'you're
        movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air.'</p>
